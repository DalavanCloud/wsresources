Legacy font encoding: Tchad2000 fonts

Compiled (and uncompiled) conversion tables for each set of fonts is included
here, which map Tchad2000 encoded data to Unicode (not vice versa).
Although each mapping file is bi-directional, conversion from Unicode back into
the legacy encoding isn't recommended, as there would be some poor diacritic
choices back in the legacy encoding. Each mapping file is currently only
intended to support legacy to Unicode conversion.
