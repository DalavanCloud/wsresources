    First, you should only need to install the .BUNDLE file alone OR the .KEYLAYOUT and .ICNS file together.  Try to install the .BUNDLE file first.  If the language does not appear in the System Preferences afterwards, then use the other two files.

    The SIL-Ɂareɂare.bundle  the must be placed in the "Keyboard Layouts" folder in the users Library folder.

The problem is that the Library folder is now hidden by default on OS X.  In order to open your personal Library folder, you need to do the following:

To find your hidden Home/Library folder, do this:

Hold down the Option key on your keyboard.

Click the Go menu in the Finder program.

The (formerly) invisible Library folder appears in the Go menu as long as the Option key is pressed.

Select Library and release the mouse button.

   Here are some web-sites which explain how to open the hidden Library folder.

    Click on the Finder Program in the Dock ( a blue-ish icon with two faces connected by a smile). Click on the Go item in the Menu Bar.  Choose Home from the drop-down list.  A new window should appear.  Look for a folder called Library.  Double-click on it.

    You will now find the Keyboard Layouts folder.  This is where you need to place the SIL-Ɂareɂare.bundle. 

Once it is installed, you should be able to find it in System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Input Sources.  Click on the + at the bottom to add the SIL-Ɂareɂare keyboard.  It may appear in the list under "alu" or it may be located under the "Others" category at the very bottom of the list.  If you can't find it, at the bottom of the list is a search box.  Type in "SIL" and it should appear in the list to the right.

    If you still don't see the SIL-Ɂareɂare keyboard, you may have to restart the computer and look again.
 

    After you restart the computer, you can follow the instructions below to install the keyboard.

1) Choose "Keyboard"
2) Click on "Input Sources" at the bottom of this screen.
3) Click on the "+" to add a keyboard.
4) Look for SIL-Ɂareɂare keyboard in the standard list.  You may have to click on "Others" to see it.
5)  If you still don't find it, try typing in "SIL" or "are" in the search box at the bottom.
6)  If you are able to find the keyboard layout it will be added to your other "Input Sources".

7) The "Show Input menu in menu bar" checkbox should be checked.

    You should be able to select the flag of the language for keyboard you want to use in the upper right side of the menubar.
