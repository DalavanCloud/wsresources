Legacy font encoding: SGkClassic and SGkClassicWeb

Two draft TECkit conversion programs are included with this package. It has not
been extensively tested. This is intended for converting texts which have
been encoded for the SGkClassic or SGkClassicWeb legacy font to Unicode. The converter 
may not work well if the two fonts were used together as some people used breathing 
marks in one font and base characters from the other font. The conversion then is 
quite buggy.
