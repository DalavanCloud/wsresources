Legacy font encoding: SIL Galatia

Two draft conversion programs are included with this package. One is for
Consistent Changes and the other is for TECkit. Neither of the Greek mappings
have been extensively tested. These are intended for converting texts which have
been encoded for the SIL Galatia legacy font to Unicode (Galatia SIL is a Greek
Unicode font).
