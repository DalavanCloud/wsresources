SenAjami5 font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the SenAjami5 font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the SenAjami5 fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

SenAjami5 was derived from SenAjam4 and ultimately from Scheherazade.

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for  
Arabic-based writing systems used in Senegal. This font makes use of 
state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic issues. 

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * SenAjami5 Regular

This release supports  the Unicode 6.1 Arabic character 
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
recommended for normal use), focusing on a subset used in Senegal. 

Font smarts are implemented using both OpenType and Graphite.
technology. 

ChangeLog
---------


Senajami5 version 1.2
- Graphite above marks attachment to final form of U+064A, U+08A8, U+08A9 and isolate form of U+0648 corrected.
- spacing between Dal isolate/final to Jeem/Ain isolate forms (and their derivatives) reduced.

SenAjami5 version 1.0
- Graphite Font Features 
'seck' (M.Seck style glyph shapes - DAL) added. 
'tone' (Raised/offset below mark to allow for second below mark)
Accessable through Graphite enabled applications such as OpenOffice 3.5, and 'Worldpad'. Using 'SenAjami5' or 'SenAjami5:seck=0' as the font name will give you the default behaviour with the 'classic' DAL glyph shape. Using 'SenAjami5:seck=1' as the font name will yield the M.Seck style DAL glyph shape prefferd in Senegal.
	 


The supported codepoints in the U+08A0 plane and the PUA are currently 
only available on LibreOffice 3.5.0 and Worldpad. The equivalent functionality, is programed into the font for OpenType and will be available whenever Microsoft get round to supporting Unicode 6.1.

- Released under OFL
- supported subset includes:
U+0601, U+060C, U+0610-0615, U+061B, U+061E, U+061F, U+0621-063A, U+0640-065E, 
U+0660-06FF, U+0750-076D, U+08A0, 
U+08A2-08AC, U+08E4-08FE, U+E000-E00D
- limited support for latin chars
- proposed unicode code point U+08A1 supported for development purposes only, not suitable for current projects.
