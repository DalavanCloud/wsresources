SenAjami4 font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the SenAjami4 font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the SenAjami4 fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

SenAjami4 was derived from Scheherazade.

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for  
Arabic-based writing systems used in Senegal. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
technologies to support complex typographic issues. 

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * SenAjami4 Regular

This release supports  the Unicode 5.0 Arabic character 
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
recommended for normal use), focusing on a subset used in Senegal with 
fourteen addtional characters in the Private Use Area, hacked back into the 
standard Arabic block due to the lack of R-t-L Private Use Area support in Unicode. 

Font smarts are implemented using both OpenType and Graphite.
technology. The current version of Graphite does not support auto-mirroring of parenthesis etc... 
However smarts have been added to the font to compensate in Graphite enabled applications such as LibreOffice 3.4.3.

ChangeLog
---------
SenAjami4 version 1.001
OT behaviour of U+062F and derivatives amended.
Graphite Font Features 'Hack' (Hacked/Proposed codepoints) and 'DAL' (Classic/M.Seck glyph shapes) added. Currently only accessible through 'Worldpad'.

SenAjami4 version 1.0
Graphite support added. Coverage of OT and Graphite extended to whole of Arabic and Arabic Supplement blocks.
Graphite correctly attaches stacked above and below marks (i.e. shadda + vowel +tone). OT tone marks only stack on top of above marks.
U+062F and derivatives revert to classic roman nose form.

versions jumped from 0.3 to 1.0 with inclusion of Graphite.

SenAjami4 version 0.3
behaviour of U+0631, U+0632 and U+0648 modified to avoid collision between glyphs.

SenAjami4 version 0.2
support added for 'latin turned e', schwa and 'arrows symbols' U+25BC, U+25B2, U+25BC, U+25C4, U+25BA, U+2190, U+2192
U+002F and U+005C equalised
