Pending the addition of the Tai Viet script to Unicode, the Tai Viet Working Group agreed on a temporary PUA-based encoding for Tai Viet text. Since the release of Unicode 5.2, this Tai Viet PUA encoding is obsolete, and any text encoded with it (including text that uses the 2008 Tai Heritage Design Review font) should be converted to Unicode. A Tai-Viet-PUA-to-Unicode mapping table, usable with the SIL Converters software, is provided here for that purpose.
