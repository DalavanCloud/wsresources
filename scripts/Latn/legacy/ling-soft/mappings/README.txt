These TECkit mapping files are for fonts which were distributed with Translator's Workplace and created by Linguist's Software.

The mapping file is denoted with an asterisk (*). Below the mapping file name are the names of the truetype fonts
for which you can use the mapping file.

Note that not all of the mapping files are complete or accurate and they have only been minimally tested. 
If you have corrections to make, please email: <lorna_priest@sil.org>

For some of these fonts it will be difficult to find a replacement font that contains all the characters.
