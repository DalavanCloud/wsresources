The TECkit mapping file is denoted with an asterisk (*). Below the mapping file name are 
the names of the truetype fonts for which you can use the mapping file.

We have a created a new font called Apparatus SIL which is based on SIL Apparatus. That font
can be applied to converted data. There are 20 characters from SIL Apparatus that are not
in Unicode. We have output U+FFFD in front of the base character. If you search for U+FFFD 
you can use text markup to make the following character superscript.

SILAB.ttf	SIL Apparatus Bold
SILABI.ttf SIL Apparatus Bold Italic
