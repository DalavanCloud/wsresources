This mapping file was designed to convert text using the custom-encoded 
GeezTypeNet font to Unicode text.

Since using the GeezTypeNet font enabled people to use several different sequences
to represent one Unicode character, it is quite probable that this mapping file 
will not cover all potential uses.

We will be happy to receive suggested updates to the mapping files.
