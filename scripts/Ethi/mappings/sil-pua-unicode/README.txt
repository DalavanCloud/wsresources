If you happened to obtain an early unreleased version of the SIL Abyssinica
font, and used some of the Private Use Area (PUA) codepoints in your data, you
may wish to use the following mapping file to convert your data from PUA
codepoints to Unicode 6.0 (many of the PUA characters were added to Unicode
4.1 and 6.0).
